    "# Neural Network Verification for DC-OPF\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Jupyter Notebook for the **Neural Network Verification for DC-OPF** tutorial, presented at the **Oslo Workshop of AI-EFFECT**. In this tutorial, we focus on verifying a neural network model designed to predict solutions for the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problemâ€”an essential optimization task in power system operations. The objective of the DC-OPF is to determine the optimal dispatch of generators to meet system demand, typically aiming for the most cost-efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our neural network, the input consists of the system's load profile, and the output is the predicted generator dispatch that minimizes cost. We trained the network on 80,000 samples and tested it using 20,000 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we will assess the network's performance by examining how accurately it predicts the generator dispatch, and whether any predicted dispatches violate generator limits or line flow constraints. The analysis will proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Violations on the Entire Dataset: We will begin by identifying any violations in the predictions across the complete dataset (100,000 samples).\n",
    "2. Worst-Case Violations Over the Continuous Input Domain: Next, we will explore the worst-case violations across the entire continuous input domain, demonstrating how violations can be more severe when considering all possible inputs.\n",
    "3. Worst-Case Distance to Optimality: Finally, we will evaluate the worst-case deviation from the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three experiments will highlight the importance of verification in neural network models, especially in critical applications like power system operations.\n",
